- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey a sense of innovation and clarity. This hue supports the app's focus on project management with its connotations of trust and efficiency.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E5F5F9), very close to white. The intention is to create a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting purple (#9C27B0) to draw attention to important actions and elements, energizing the interface while maintaining a professional look.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent various task types and project actions.
- Gantt chart area takes up the main portion of the screen. Side panel for the configuration options.
- Use subtle animations when tasks are added, edited, or completed. Add transition animations when tasks get dependencies. Avoid obtrusive effects.
